# Anycubic Vyper Config Files 

This repository holds configuration info for the Anycubic Vyper with Revo 6 hotend &amp; Microswiss extruder

Please be careful. Using these files without knowing the limitations of your printer can cause damage to it. Varibles such as bed mesh, z-tilt, and extruder rotation distance should be calibrated for your machine. 

To use these files: 

Place them in your Klipper configs directory. Usually located at ~/home/pi/printer_data/config/ 

Alternatively, you can open up Mainsail, navigate to Machine, and upload these files there, or copy the raw data into new files. Just make sure you back stuff up before proceeding.
